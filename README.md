# Project
I Have uploaded my project ipynb file by compressing the size as github has a limit of uploading size.

I have done my project on three dataset :
1-Motion Capture Hand Postures Data Set - 5 types of hand postures from 12 users were recorded using unlabeled markers on fingers of a glove in a motion capture environment.
2.MNIST dataset - The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
3.Water Potability Visualization -  water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.
